# Exploring_JAVA
Hii, I'm glad that you found this, so a short gist of this repo goes like this, I'm a tech enthusiast I literally love to code yeah I know that's not usual but somehow this is the place where I can spend hours with looking the clock ticking, so in my leisure time I explore and build a variety of random stuffs (PS: peak randomness - IDK Either until its fully built) ;

so , this a a random piece of me!! 
         I'll basically start to code not even without an topic later on the go I'll choose a topic then some or the other way I just keep changing tracks and give a end product that's actually satisfies, I try try and try to get the best possible code I could ever do!!
         I'm a little weirdo when it comes to coding , tech & exploring ohere I meant exploring the world ,
         I literally love going offline walking through green natue where the watefall sounds just keep resonating!!😁
So these are few stuffs you might find scrolling down (If you are not able to scroll down then you're too early ;) so just explore what's in there now , maybe check in I'm Sure you might find new stuffs in there)
Also, If you find anythying not in place in this repo just remember I'm a Beginner and you are too early!!😅

so few projects I recently explored!!

----TIC TAC TOE----
         -> i was bored nd i literally wanted to play , i know i could hv done it with pen and paper but taking a scenic route is my style!
         -> it actually turned out good but fun fact, I didnt expect this to be too short honestly!!
         -> and in short, its a time spent well!!

----DIGITAL CLOCK----
         -> Bored again , nd all i wanted was to see the time pass
         -> usualy the moblie phone nd desktop screen show time in HH:MM format nd that was totally not enough for me (I was literally bored to an extent that every minute felt like a decade) so I decided I'll make one in the HH:MM:SS format
         -> yes!! I Know this is a common project that every one in this field do this project in their early career years but a backstory like this new right?!?!
         -> Just have a look, and have a great time!!

----CALCULATOR----
         -> ok, this Calculator doesn't have a great story unfortunately 🥴, but making it was a full big bag of fun
         -> making a calc wasn't a huge deal at all added that this is a basic Calc
         ->the true challenge was in bringing out the perfect layout nd yep that actually taught me more than what theory could do, by this i just had a super clesr view of the swing layouts nd especially the grid layout and the grid bag layout 
         -> and honestly working with grid bag layout for a first timer wasn't easy to be honest , the application went messier each time that it actually was but in the end it wass all good
         -> then to give it a little spice i had to play with colours nd this is how it turned out and for me it's pretty awesome!!

Okayy now speaking about those projects I tried but that didn't work the way I wanted it to work, so this one called "SimpPaint" is basically a replica of paint application especially suitable for free hand sketchs but its main component is the MouseMotionListener and I messed up at that part yepp so the issue over here was, I was actually able to draw but the fact over here is that the sketch & the mouse pointer had a bit lag , and this was not something I expected so I worked on it to bring out the better version!!

----SIMPPAINT THEBETTERVERSION----
         -> yea!! it worked the way I wanted it to so that's great!!
         -> and intresting part I gave access to more then 8 colours and yes thats an mini celeb factor with regard to this proj coz it actoally consumed a lot time that i expected

----ATTENDENCE PERCENTAGE CALCULATOR----
PS: Yes!! It's for all those students out there ( each and every student really needs this and this was never a secret fr);
         -> for the very first time while coding I  addressed the topic that is really in need , yet there are many like this out in the playstore a personalised one will be much much better IMO :)
Also, From now you can find not only the stories behind but also the actual product itself!!
Adding my projects to the repo and if you want to try it or modify it then just pull it and let me know how did it make you feel!!!!
