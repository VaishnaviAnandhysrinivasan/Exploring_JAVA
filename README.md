# Exploring_JAVA
Hii, I'm glad that you found this, so a short gist of this repo goes like this, I'm a tech enthusiast I literally love to code yeah I know that's not usual but somehow this is the place where I can spend hours with looking the clock ticking, so in my leisure time I explore and build a variety of random stuffs (PS: peak randomness - IDK Either until its fully built) ;

so , this a a random piece of me!! 
         I'll basically start to code not even without an topic later on the go i'll choose a topic then some or the other way I just keep changing tracks and give a end product that's actually satisfies, I try try and try to get the best possible code I could ever do!!
         I'm a little weirdo when it comes to coding , tech & exploring ohere I meant exploring the world ,
         I literally love going offline walking through green natue where the watefall sounds just keep resonating!!😁
So these are few stuffs you might find scrolling down (If you are not able to scroll down then you're too early ;) so just explore what's in there now , maybe check in I'm Sure you might find new stuffs in there)
Also, If you find anythying not in place in this repo just remember I'm a Beginner!!😅

so few projects I recently explored!!

----TIC TAC TOE----
         -> i was bored nd i literally wanted to play , i know i could hv done it with pen and paper but taking a scenic route is my style!
         -> it actually turned out good but fun fact, I didnt expect this to be too short honestly!!
         -> and in short, its a time spent well!!

----DIGITAL CLOCK----
         -> Bored again , nd all i wanted was to see time pass
         -> usualy the moblie phone nd desktop screen show time in HH:MM format nd that was totally not enough for me (I was literally bored to an extent that every minute felt like a decade) so I decided I'll make one in the HH:MM:SS format
         -> yes!! I Know this is a common project that every one in this field do this project in their early career years but a backstory like this new right?!?!
         -> Just have a look, and have a great time!!

----CALCULATOR----
         ->
